Abstract
This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on the XGBoost algorithm, to predict the presence of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) through voice pattern analysis. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset including vocal frequency measurements and demographic data, the XGBoost model achieves a remarkable accuracy of approximately 93.33%. Data preprocessing techniques such as Min-Max scaling and SMOTE are applied to enhance model performance. Additionally, utilizing Python libraries including scikit-learn, NumPy, and pandas, the study demonstrates the efficacy of XGBoost in diagnosing Parkinson’s disease, achieving an accuracy of 94.87% with minimal voice features.
